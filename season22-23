<p style="background-color: black; color: white;font-size:40px">The San Antonio team has a lot of tradition in the American basketball league. However, with the retirement of its main names in recent decades, the team was limited, with young and inexperienced players. The team has not been in the Playoffs for 3 seasons.The expectation is on top of coach Greg Popovich, who has commanded the team for 26 years and manages to take his athletes to the best level of basketball.
